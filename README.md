# Whitewater-Adventures
A sample dashboard application built with AngularJS that uses custom, re-usable, components and transclusion. 
It uses angular-gridster for creating dashboard widgets that are draggable and resizable. ngStorage is used to save
any changes to the dashboard into local storage.

To run the app: 
Simply clone or download the project to your hard drive and load up the index.html in a browser.
The application uses a mock data service to supply the data and prevents a complex setup or configuration.
